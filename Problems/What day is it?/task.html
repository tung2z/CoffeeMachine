  <p>Today the whole world uses the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) to distinguish between the time zones. The UTC is considered to be the 0, and the rest of the time zones are expressed using positive or negative offsets from the UTC. For instance, London is in the zone UTC+00:00 (or GMT) and Moscow is in the zone UTC+3:00.&nbsp;</p> 
  <p>There are 14 positive offsets (from UTC+1:00 to UTC+14:00) and 12 negative offsets (from UTC-12:00 to UTC-1:00). This also means that at a particular hour, three calendar days are observed on the planet.</p> 
  <p>Imagine, it is Tuesday, 10:30 in the morning in London (UTC). What day of the week is it in a specific timezone?</p> 
  <p><strong>The input format:</strong></p> 
  <p>The value of offset with the sign (e.g. +3 or -9).</p> 
  <p><strong>The output format:</strong></p> 
  <p>The day of the week in that timezone.&nbsp;</p>
